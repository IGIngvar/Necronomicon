  > - All minions other than Raging Spirits deal more damage at lower levels. This damage bonus levels out to no change at minion level 70 for minions other than Raised Zombies and Summoned Skeletons. (Minion level is based on the level requirement of their gem).
  > - Summoned Raging Spirits now deal approximately 15% less damage at all levels.
  > - Summon Skeletons has been renamed Summon Skeleton, and has been reworked. Many of the passives and items that interact with it have been rebalanced.

It now summons a single skeleton per cast and has a base limit of 5 summoned skeletons.
  > - The Summoned Skeleton Warrior minion's attack time has been reduced to 0.8 seconds, and its base damage has been increased by approximately 66%. Summoned Skeleton Mage minion's cast time has been reduced to 1.2 seconds.
  > - Summoned Skeleton Mages now deal 50% more damage at gem level 20, and significantly more damage at earlier gem levels. Their behaviour has been tweaked and they will no longer flee.
  > - Labyrinth helmet enchantments for Summon Skeleton now grant a 20/40% chance to summon an additional Skeleton minion. This applies to existing Labyrinth enchantments.
  > - Raised Zombies have had their damage increased, up to 45% more damage at level 20 than previously.
